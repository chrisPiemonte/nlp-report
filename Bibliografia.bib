abstract="Conversational interfaces can be built using a variety of technologies. This chapter shows how to create a conversational interface using chatbot technology in which pattern matching is used to interpret the user's input and templates are used to provide the system's output. Numerous conversational interfaces have been built in this way, initially to develop systems that could engage in conversation in a human-like way but also more recently to create automated online assistants to complement or even replace human-provided services in call centers. In this chapter, some working examples of conversational interfaces using the Pandorabots platform are presented, along with a tutorial on AIML, a markup language for specifying conversational interactions.",
